// In early days js was used in frontend only as scripting language for the browser.
// In this period the javascript was not supported in the server, so python ,java, php,etc were used as backend

// Later on concept of node.js was introduced as a runtime for javascript on the server side.
// Now the runtime (node.js) is responsible for executing the javascript code on thr server side.

// Node.js (library) is the runtime prototype/protocol which is complex and has a lot of features.
// Then Express js was introduced as the framework instead of core node.js.

// API (Backend/Server)(waiter)
// --> Application Programming Interface.
// It serves as a bridge between frontend(us/user) and databse(chef).


// Nodejs is environemnt and its framework is express
// Steps to create a backend server using Express.js

1. Create a backend folder and go inside it
2. npm init -y (package.json will created then)
3. npm i express  (then install express)
4. npm i mongoose (MongoDB is database,mongoose is language of that database)
5. "type": "module", Add this in package.json
6. npm i nodemon ---> Keeps the server running(nodemon server.js(yesle server chalaucha))

// MongoDB 
// MongoDB is NoSQL databse.
// It stores data in the form of documents and collection.(this is json)

const student = this is the documents
{
    name: 
    age: 
}

// Backend cannot talk to database directly, it should use mongoose to talk to the database.
